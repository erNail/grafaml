Generate Grafana dashboards from YAML with automatic panel positioning using Helm Chart templating.

This YAML:

```yaml
dashboardBase:
  title: "Simple Dashboard"

panels:
  columns: 2
  panelHeight: 8
  list:
    - title: "Prometheus Targets Up"
      type: "stat"
      targets:
        - expr: "up"

    - title: "Resource Usage in Percent"
      description: "Memory and CPU Usage"
      type: "stat"
      targets:
        - expr: "(1 - (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)) * 100"
          legendFormat: "Memory Usage"
        - expr: "sum by (instance, job)(avg by (mode, instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!='idle'}[2m]))) * 100"
          legendFormat: "CPU Usage"

    - title: "Memory Usage in Percent over Time"
      type: "timeseries"
      targets:
        - expr: "(1 - (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)) * 100"

    - title: "CPU Usage in Percent over Time"
      type: "timeseries"
      targets:
        - expr: "sum by (instance, job) (avg by (mode, instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!='idle'}[2m])))"
```

Becomes this dashboard:

## Features

**Dashboards from YAML**: Instead of using the Grafana UI or writing complex JSON models,
you can write simplified YAML files from which the dashboard JSON is generated.
This allows better version control and code reviews.

**Automatic panel positioning**: Grafana doesn't support relative positioning.
When trying to write your dashboard as JSON, you need to set and keep track of the position of every panel yourself.
`grafaml` arranges panels based on their definition order in a grid with a flexible number of columns.

**Kubernetes-ready**: `grafaml` is a Helm Chart.
Grafana dashboards can be deployed as ConfigMaps,
which can optionally be discovered by the [Grafana Sidecar Container][1].

## Limitations

**Variable Positioning of Panels**: Panels are arranged in a grid based on their definition order.
Due to this, it is not possible to have panels with variable width or positioning.

## Getting started

### Creating the dashboard YAML

First we need to create a Helm Values file containing the definition of our dashboard.
We'll call the file `values-my-dashboard.yaml`.
It will define a very simple dashboard with only 2 panels:

```yaml
title: "Simple Dashboard"
panels:
  colums: 2
  panelHeight: 8
  list:
    - title: "Memory Usage in Percent over Time"
      type: "timeseries"
      targets:
        - expr: "(1 - (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)) * 100"
    - title: "CPU Usage in Percent over Time"
      type: "timeseries"
      targets:
        - expr: "sum by (instance, job) (avg by (mode, instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!='idle'}[2m])))"
```

You can find all possible configuration options in the [default `values.yaml`](./chart/values.yaml)
and in the [`README.md` of the Helm Chart`](./chart/README.md).
Be aware that the`values-my-dashboard.yaml` will be merged with the [default `values.yaml`](./chart/values.yaml).

You can find example dashboards in the [`example-dashboards`](./example-dashboards/) directory.

### Generating the dashboard JSON

This step is optional if you want to
[deploy the dashboard in a Kubernetes Cluster](#deploying-the-dashboard-in-kubernetes).

Execute the following to create a `dashboard.json`:

```shell
# Adapt the variables to your needs
name="my-dashboard"
values="./values-my-dashboard.yaml"
helm template $name oci://registry-1.docker.io/ernail/grafaml --values $values --set onlyRenderDashboardJson=true | tail -n +3 > dashboard.json
```

### Deploying the dashboard in Kubernetes

Execute the following in your shell to deploy the dashboard as a ConfigMap in Kubernetes:

```shell
name="my-dashboard"
values="./values-my-dashboard.yaml"
namespace="my-namespace"
helm upgrade $name oci://registry-1.docker.io/ernail/grafaml --install --create-namespace --namespace $namespace --values $values
```

If you are using the [Grafana Sidecar Container][1], the dashboard should now be available in your Grafana instance.

## Advanced Usage

### Grafana JSON Model Compatibility

`grafaml` generates standard Grafana JSON dashboards, which means you can use almost any feature that Grafana supports.
The `dashboardBase` field of the values file accepts any field compatible with the
[Grafana JSON Dashboard model](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/view-dashboard-json-model/),
with only two exceptions:

- **`uid`**: This is generated automatically, or can be set via the field `uid` in the values file.
- **`panels`**: These are configured and automatically positioned via the field `panels` in the values.

This means you can configure advanced features like:

- Custom time ranges and refresh intervals
- Dashboard variables and templating
- Annotations and alerts
- Custom styling and themes
- Dashboard tags and metadata

**Important limitation**: Due to the automatic grid-based positioning of panels,
certain panel types like `row` panels will interfere with the positioning logic.
All items in `panels.list` are treated as regular panels and positioned in the grid sequence.

### Using Helmfile

[Helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) is a declarative spec for deploying Helm Charts.
It can be used to simplify the commands for rendering and deploying the dashboards.

If you want to use Helmfile, here is an example `helmfile.yaml`:

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: "ernail"
    url: "registry-1.docker.io/ernail"
    oci: true

releases:
  - name: "my-dashboard"
    namespace: "my-namespace"
    chart: "ernail/grafaml"
    version: "1.0.0"
    values:
      - "./values-my-dashboard.yaml"
      - onlyRenderDashboardJson: false
```

Execute the following to create a `dashboard.json`:

```shell
helmfile template --file ./helmfile.yaml --set onlyRenderDashboardJson=true | tail -n +3 > dashboard.json
```

Execute this code in your shell to deploy the dashboard as ConfigMap in Kubernetes:

```shell
helmfile apply --file ./helmfile.yaml
```

## Development

### Install Dependencies

You can install all required dependencies via `Task` and `Homebrew`

```shell
brew install go-task
task install
```

If you'd like to use other tools,
you can find all dependencies and relevant commands in the [`taskfile.yaml`](./taskfile.yaml).

### Rendering the Helm Chart

```shell
task render
```

### Testing the Helm Chart

```shell
task test
```

### Running linters

```shell
task lint
```

### Generating documentation

```shell
task docs
```
